                            Kohsuke Nakamura is a 4th year undergraduate student inthe Fisheries System Science  Lab,  in the Department of Food Production and Environmental Management of the Faculty of Agriculture at Iwate University. Kohsuke is originally from Hakodate City, Hokkaido Prefecture. Kohsuke graduated from the Hakodate Municipal High School in 2016. His father being a fisherman, Kohsuke grew up on a fishing boat since he was a child. His current research is building upon such experience. Specifically, he is investigating how the concept of portfolio management can be applied to multi-species fisheries across Japan, usingset net fisheries as a case study. Alongside his research, Kohsuke is using R to studyand learn more about time series analysis as well as modern portfolio theory, among other things.
